# Tutorials on MONAI
- This repository contains a collection of MONAI tutorials, demonstrating how to use this powerful framework for deep learning in medical imaging. 
- Each tutorial includes a Google Colab notebook with detailed explanation, code examples, and simple tasks that help eith practicing the ttopics covered in the tutorial.

"MONAI" stands for **Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence**

MONAI consists of three frameworks:
*   MONAI Label: seemlessly integrates into label generation workflow
*   MONAI Core: enables clinicians and researchers to build AI models to work on **Medical Imaging** data
*   MONAI Deploy: facilitates easy transition of Python programs into a deployable application


These colab notebook will introduce you to the *MONAI Core*'s design and architecture.
