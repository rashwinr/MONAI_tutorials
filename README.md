# Tutorials on MONAI

This repository contains a collection of tutorials on MONAI (Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence), demonstrating how to use this powerful framework for deep learning in medical imaging.

Each tutorial includes a Google Colab notebook with detailed explanations, code examples, and hands-on exercises that help you practice the topics covered.

"MONAI" stands for **Medical Open Network for Artificial Intelligence**

MONAI consists of three frameworks:

*   MONAI Label: seamlessly integrates into label generation workflow
*   MONAI Core: enables clinicians and researchers to build AI models to work on **Medical Imaging** data
*   MONAI Deploy: facilitates easy transition of Python programs into a deployable application

These Colab notebooks will introduce you to the *MONAI Core*'s design and architecture.

## About

These Colab notebooks were developed during my post-doctoral tenure at the [Medical Imaging Group](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/MIG/index.html) with [Prof. Phaneendra Yalavarthy](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/people/phaneendra-kumar-yalavarthy/), Professor of Medical Imaging, [Computational Data Sciences](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science. 

The notebooks are a part of the course [Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Theory to Practice](https://asterhealthacademy.com/courses/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare-theory-to-practice/), which is part of the curriculum jointly offered by [Aster Health Academy](https://asterhealthacademy.com/) and [Indian Institute of Science](https://www.iisc.ac.in/).
